# Hi I'm Alex,

I'm a blockchain enthusiast and software developer who loves working on cool projects. I'm all about Smart Contracts, EVM, Solidity, and React, and I'm always down to try out new technologies.

I'm proud to have contributed to projects like GasHawk, which helps save users money on Ethereum transactions, and DM3, a decentralized messaging protocol that provides secure communication within the Web3 ecosystem. I'm a team player and love to collaborate on awesome projects with other like-minded folks.

Let's create something amazing together!
